The project development was not possible to separate to sprints as we planned,
because two members of the team (xmaroc00, xpasyn00) were not able to work on the project for a long time.

So most of the work was done by the leader (xmoise01) of the team, who was able to work on the project.
Some tasks assigned to the other members were not done, so the leader had to do them as well.

The initial tasks assignment was done more or less equally,
but the final result is that the leader did most of the work.

However, some tasks, assigned to the other members, were done by them.
Their code changes were reviewed by the leader and merged into the project during the code review process.
Some code changes were required in order to merge the changes into the project and were done by the project members.

The communication process via Telegram app was working well and as planned.
Team members were telling, if they will be able or not to attend weekly meetings.
The short summary of the meeting and the plan for the next week was sent to the team members after the meeting in chat.

YouTrack application was used for the project management during the whole development process.
The application was used for the tasks assignment, tracking the progress of the tasks and the project.
The experience with the application was good, and it was easy to use.

GitHub was used for the source code management, the code review process and CI/CD workflows.
The experience with GitHub was good, and it was easy to use.

Summary: 3/4
* Some tasks were not done as planned by other members, but were later done by the leader (not expected to happen initially)
* The communication process was working well and as expected (expected to happen initially)
* The project management was done using YouTrack and satisfied our needs (expected to happen initially)
* The source code management was done using GitHub and satisfied our needs (expected to happen initially)
