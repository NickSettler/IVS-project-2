# Sprints

There are 3 sprints in this project. Each sprint is 1 week long.

The first sprint will be used to set up the project, create the basic structure of the application and create math
library.

The second sprint will be used to implement the main features of the application: adding calculator layout, connecting
it with math library, implementing the calculator logic and writing user information and help section.

The third sprint will be used to implement the advanced features of the application: adding sets information layout and
reviewing design.

During each sprint there is a new test set added. There are 3 test sets for this project: lexical analysis tests, syntax
analysis tests and execution tests.

# Tasks

Tasks by their assignees are presented in xmoise01_xmaroc00_xpasyn00_plan_issues.pdf.

Ghant chart for better visualization of the project plan is presented in xmoise01_xmaroc00_xpasyn00_plan_gantt.pdf.

The YouTrack issue tracker by JetBrains will be used for managing, because all members of the team are familiar with it.

# Communication channels and rules

All online communication about the project will be done through the Telegram group chat. The group chat will be used for
sharing information, discussing the project and for asking questions.

Offline communication consists of weekly meetings. Each meeting is held at the end of the sprint and is used to review
the work done and to plan the next sprint.

This communication plan is chosen because it is the most convenient for all team members and has been used in previous
projects.

# Version Control System

The project will be stored in a Git repository. The repository will be hosted on GitHub. The repository will be private
and only accessible to the team members and the teacher. The repository will be made public after the project is
finished.

All project-related files will be stored in the repository. This includes the source code, documentation, test sets and
other files.

The invitation to the repository was sent to all team members and the teacher.
