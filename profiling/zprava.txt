According to the profiler output it seems, that most of the execution time is spent for <anonymous> functions.
These functions in most cases are anonymous functions passed for tree traversal during Executor class actions.
This means, that for optimisation of the code, it is necessary to refactor functions, which are using
tree traversal post order algorithm, to traverse the tree and compute the result in Executor class.

The next step is to refactor getNextToken method of the Lexer class which tokenizes the input string.

The current version of the code uses about 30% of the execution time for the mentioned processes.
The total execution time is about 335ms.
The refactor process definitely cannot reduce this execution time by 30%, but probably, the half of the value is achievable.
This means that the execution time can be reduced to about 285ms.
